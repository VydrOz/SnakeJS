## About

What better way to practice and have fun than coding a "snake game"?! So... that's what I did.

**SnakeJS** is a basic snake game with a unique design. I'm definitely not a UI/UX designer but I like the end result, so i expect you like too.

<summary>#1 - Spoiler</summary>
<br>

If you click on the "Snake" logo, it will animate and make a call sound.
This sound refers to the _Codec_ sound in the game "[_Metal Gear Solid_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear)", in which the main charater is "_Solid **Snake**_".
